## About the Project

**Clarity** is a generative AI-powered career navigation tool designed to support mid-career professionals facing disruption due to automation and rapidly evolving technologies.

### What Inspired Us

The future of work is being reshaped by emergent technologies like AI and automation, which are replacing existing skill sets at an unprecedented pace. We were inspired by the realization that navigating a career transition is uniquely difficult for professionals who have been in the workforce for years. Many feel uncertain about what steps to take, and often they face these transitions alone. We wanted to build a tool that could give people clarity—about their options, their futures, and the concrete steps they can take to stay competitive and fulfilled.

### How We Built It

We designed Clarity to simulate possible futures:

- First, we collect key information from users: current skills, interests, experiences, and career goals.
- Then, we use generative AI to produce **five** potential future career pathways, each spanning 5–10 years.
- Each pathway includes milestones (e.g., skill upgrades, new roles), recommended resources (courses, books, certifications), and personalized guidance.
- Finally, we package this into an intuitive UI that helps users choose the future they want—and start walking toward it.

### What We Learned

- Career uncertainty is emotional as well as strategic. People don’t just want suggestions; they want reassurance and agency.
- AI is a powerful ally, but only when guided by rich, human-centered inputs. The more nuanced the intake, the better the output.
- Mid-career transitioners are underserved. Most career tools focus on college students or early-career professionals. There's a gap we can help fill.

### Challenges We Faced

- Designing AI-generated career paths that feel **coherent**, **personal**, and **credible** across a 10-year timeline was nontrivial.
- Ensuring **interpretability**: Users need to understand *why* a pathway is being recommended, not just *what* it is.
- Scoping the intake questions was tricky—we had to strike a balance between depth and user effort.
- Mapping dynamic learning resources and opportunities (e.g., job listings, mentorships) to AI-generated timelines proved complex.

### What’s Next

- **Deeper AI Integration**: Expand the scope and intelligence of intake with conversational chat.
- **Dynamic Planning**: Let the career paths evolve as users learn and grow.
- **Real-World Hooks**: Integration with real job postings, mentorship networks, and in-person events.

### In a Sentence

Clarity uses AI to help people ask, *“What could my life look like?”*—and then shows them how to get there.
