## Deployment Configuration

### Frontend
- Built with React using `create-react-app`
- Deployed as static files using `@vercel/static-build`
- Build output directory: `frontend/build`

### Backend
- FastAPI application served as serverless functions
- Entry point: `api/index.py`
- Uses `@vercel/python` runtime

### Routes
- `/api/*` â†’ Python API serverless functions
- `/*` â†’ React frontend static files

## Environment Variables

Set these in your Vercel dashboard:

- `EXA_API_KEY` - For Exa API integration
- Any other environment variables your API needs

## Local Development

1. **Frontend**: `cd frontend && npm start`
2. **Backend**: `cd api && python api.py`
3. **Both**: Use the scripts in root `package.json`

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Local CLI Deployment
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: GitHub Integration
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Vercel will automatically detect the configuration from `vercel.json`
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!
